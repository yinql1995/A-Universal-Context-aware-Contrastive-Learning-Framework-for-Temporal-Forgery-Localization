# A-Universal-Context-aware-Contrastive-Learning-Framework-for-Temporal-Forgery-Localization
A universal context-aware contrastive learning framework for TFL that detects forged video/audio instants by contrasting them against a dynamically updated global context. Our framework is built on the core hypothesis that forged segments act as temporal anomalies relative to the global context.

## Introduction
